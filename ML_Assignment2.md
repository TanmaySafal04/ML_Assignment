# Answers

#1 The concept of human learning is that humans observe the result of their or someone else's action and learn from them to make better decision depending upon the sceneario.
Eg. i) We solve maths problem to train ourself and perform better in exams
    ii) We make valuable life decision based on teachings of our elders 

#2 There are different forms of human learning:
    i) Learning through listening and speaking
    ii) Learning through observation
    iii) Learning through touch and feel

#3 Machine Learning is art of imitating human integlligence by training using data gradually improving the accuracy of providing solution to a problem.
Key responsibilities are that they provide accurate and fast response to a problem without human intervention and without error that we humans usually make.

#4 In a reinforcement learning our model is rewarded if it makes a right move and is penalised in case of a wrong move. Hence there sequential learning and slowly the model accuracy increases.

#5 Learning as a search is basically searching across various hypothesis which best describes the training data and select that hypothesis.

#6 Goal of machine learning is to imitate human thinking capability to perform tasks just like a human. The machines are trained with data and algorithm just like a human is trained through education.

#7 In machine learning, the process of model training is similar to how humans learn. Machine learning model are trained using data and algorithm in similar way we learn through observation and teaching with examples.

ML models are evaluated based on the data that follows the same pattern as the training data to check it's performance in the same way we humans are evaluated through exams.

If the performance is poor then tuning of model is done in the similar way humans are asked to learn and practice more and then retake exams.

#8 By using abstract method we override an abstract method defined in the parent class when the parent class is inherited by a child class and then the child class is called byt creating it's object.

#9 Generalization means that our model is able to work on new data which has similar distribution like our training data which hasn't been fed to our model,

#10 In classification, the output belongs to a particular class of values in the present in target value. The prediction in this is either correct or wrong and evalution is done by means of confusion matrix. 
However in Regression there's a range of value that is the output when predicting using input features and the predicted value is usually close to the correct value if the model is a robust one.

#11 Regressiona technique for investigating the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. It's used as a method for predictive modelling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.
Regression is used to predict the house price based on no. of features such as age,area,no. of floors etc.

#12 Clustering is grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. 
Clustering is somewhere similar to the classification algorithm, but the difference is the type of dataset that we are using. In classification, we work with the labeled data set, whereas in clustering, we work with the unlabelled dataset.

#13 i)  ML is a discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides machines with the capacity to automatically learn from data and previous experiences by identifying patterns to generate predictions for new processes with minimal human intervention. Machine learning comes to the rescue in several situations where it is impossible to apply strict algorithms.

iv) Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement as for every correct move our model is rewarded hence in this way learning occurs in form of awarding for correct predictions.
