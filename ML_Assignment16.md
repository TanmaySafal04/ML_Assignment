# Answers

1. In a linear equation, the dependent variable is the variable that you are trying to predict or explain, while the independent variable is the variable that you use to make that prediction or explanation. The dependent variable is also called the response variable, and the independent variable is often referred to as the predictor or explanatory variable.

2. Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single dependent variable and a single independent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and is represented by the equation:

Y = b0 + b1*X + ε

where:

Y is the dependent variable.
X is the independent variable.
b0 is the intercept.
b1 is the slope.
ε represents the error term.
Example: Predicting a person's weight (Y) based on their height (X).

3. In a linear regression, the slope (b1) represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable. It quantifies the steepness or slope of the regression line, indicating how much the dependent variable is expected to increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) as the independent variable changes by one unit.

4. To determine the slope of a line passing through the points (3, 2) and (2, 2), you can use the formula for slope:

Slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
Slope (m) = (2 - 2) / (2 - 3)
Slope (m) = 0 / (-1)
Slope (m) = 0

The slope of the line is 0, which means the line is horizontal.

5. In linear regression, the conditions for a positive slope are:
As the independent variable increases, the dependent variable tends to increase.
There is a positive correlation between the two variables.

6. In linear regression, the conditions for a negative slope are:
As the independent variable increases, the dependent variable tends to decrease.
There is a negative correlation between the two variables.

7. Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression where you model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is expressed by the equation:

Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bn*Xn + ε
It allows you to consider the combined effect of multiple predictors on the dependent variable.

8. In multiple linear regression, the sum of squares due to error (SSE) is a measure of the total unexplained variation in the dependent variable by the regression model. It represents the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.

9. In multiple linear regression, the sum of squares due to regression (SSR) is a measure of the explained variation in the dependent variable by the regression model. It represents the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable.

10. Multicollinearity in a regression equation occurs when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other. It can lead to issues in interpretation and stability of regression coefficients because it becomes challenging to determine the unique contribution of each correlated variable.

11. Heteroskedasticity is a term used in regression analysis to describe a situation where the variability of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) is not constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). It means that the spread of residuals changes as the independent variable(s) change, violating one of the assumptions of linear regression.

12. Ridge regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the regression equation. It adds a term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which helps to shrink the coefficient estimates and reduce their variance.

13. Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is another regularization technique in linear regression. It adds a penalty term to the regression equation that encourages some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly zero, effectively performing variable selection and simplifying the model.

14. Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial equation. It can capture nonlinear relationships between variables by introducing polynomial terms like X^2, X^3, etc., in addition to the linear term (X).

15. Basis functions are mathematical functions used in polynomial regression to transform the original independent variable(s) into a set of functions that can model more complex relationships. For example, in polynomial regression, basis functions might include X, X^2, X^3, etc., which are used to create a polynomial regression model.

16. Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems where the dependent variable is categorical and represents two classes (e.g., yes/no, 1/0). It models the relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the event occurring using the logistic function. The result is a probability score that predicts the likelihood of one of the two classes. It's widely used in machine learning for classification tasks.
