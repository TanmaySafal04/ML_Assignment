# Answers

1. The underlying concept of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is to find a hyperplane that best separates data points belonging to different classes in a high-dimensional space. SVMs are used for both classification and regression tasks. The key idea is to maximize the margin between the nearest data points (support vectors) of different classes, which helps create a robust and well-generalized model.

2. A support vector is a data point that lies closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) in an SVM. These are the critical data points that influence the placement of the decision boundary and the margin. Support vectors play a crucial role in defining the SVM model.

3. It is necessary to scale the inputs when using SVMs because SVMs are sensitive to the scale of features. If the features have different scales, the SVM may prioritize some features over others during the training process, leading to suboptimal results. Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the SVM's decision-making process.

4. Yes, an SVM classifier can output a confidence score. In SVM, the distance of a data point from the decision boundary can be used as a measure of confidence. Larger distances indicate higher confidence in the classification. However, SVMs do not provide a percentage chance or probability directly like some other classifiers (e.g., logistic regression). To estimate probabilities, you can use methods like Platt scaling or isotonic regression on the SVM's decision values.

5. When dealing with a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features, it is often better to use the dual form of the SVM problem. The dual form is computationally more efficient in such high-dimensional scenarios compared to the primal form.

6. If an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel appears to underfit the training data, you should try increasing the gamma parameter. A higher gamma value makes the kernel function more sensitive to the individual data points, which can lead to a more complex decision boundary. You might also want to adjust the C parameter; increasing C allows for more flexibility in the margin and can help reduce underfitting.

7. To solve the soft-margin linear SVM classifier problem with an off-the-shelf Quadratic Programming (QP) solver, you should set the QP parameters as follows:

H (Hessian matrix): Constructed from the training data and kernel function.
f (linear coefficient vector): Typically a vector of -1s (for maximizing the margin).
A (matrix for inequality constraints): Defines the constraints on the slack variables.
b (right-hand side vector for inequality constraints): Typically contains the values 0 for soft-margin SVMs.
Training different linear classifiers (LinearSVC, SVC with linear kernel, and SGDClassifier) on a linearly separable dataset should yield similar models, as they all aim to find a linear decision boundary. The choice between them may come down to optimization algorithms, regularization methods, or specific hyperparameters.

8. Training an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset using one-versus-the-rest (OvR) strategy for multi-class classification can achieve high precision. The exact precision will depend on the choice of hyperparameters, the kernel, and the complexity of the model. Precision can be optimized through hyperparameter tuning and careful feature selection.

9. To train an SVM regressor on the California housing dataset, you can use SVM for regression (SVR). The goal is to predict a continuous target variable, such as house prices. The performance of the regressor will depend on the choice of kernel, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing. You can evaluate its performance using regression metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared (R^2) to assess the quality of the predictions.
