# Answers

1. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through data-driven learning, without being explicitly programmed. It works by training models on historical data to make predictions or decisions.

Two Business Applications:

Customer Churn Prediction: Businesses can use machine learning to analyze customer behavior data to predict which customers are likely to leave or "churn." This allows companies to take proactive steps to retain valuable customers by offering incentives or personalized offers.

Recommendation Systems: E-commerce platforms and streaming services employ recommendation algorithms to suggest products or content to users based on their past behavior and preferences. This enhances user engagement and increases sales or viewership.

Ethical Concerns:

Bias: Machine learning models can inherit biases present in training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes.

Privacy: Gathering and analyzing personal data for machine learning can raise concerns about user privacy.

Job Displacement: Automation through machine learning can lead to job losses in certain industries.

2. Human Learning:

i. Under the supervision of experts involves structured learning under the guidance of experienced individuals. Examples include apprenticeships, medical residencies, or learning to play a musical instrument with a teacher.

ii. With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner learners have access to resources or materials created by experts but may not have direct interaction with them. Examples include online courses, textbooks, or instructional videos.

iii. Self-education where individuals take responsibility for their own learning without formal supervision. Examples include reading books, watching educational YouTube videos, or using online tutorials.

3. Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where it learns to map input data to known output labels. Examples: image classification, spam email detection.

Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm is given data without labeled outputs, and it identifies patterns or structures within the data. Examples: clustering customer segments, topic modeling.

Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. Examples: game playing, autonomous robotics.

Semi-supervised Learning: A combination of labeled and unlabeled data is used for training. It's useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers. Used in image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

5. Well-Posed Learning Problem:

A well-posed learning problem has the following characteristics:

The learning task and its objectives are precisely specified.

There is an adequate amount of relevant data available for training.

A measurable metric is defined to evaluate the model's performance.

Solving the problem with machine learning is feasible and beneficial.

6. Capabilities of Machine Learning:

Machine learning is a powerful tool but not capable of solving all problems. Its effectiveness depends on data availability, problem complexity, and domain suitability.
Machine learning is well-suited for tasks involving pattern recognition, prediction, and optimization. It excels in tasks where large datasets and computational power are available.
However, it may not work well for problems with insufficient data, inherently unpredictable outcomes, or when human judgment, ethics, or creativity are required.

7. Methods and Technologies for Solving Machine Learning Problems (Two examples):

Gradient Boosting: A machine learning ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy. Algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM are popular implementations.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): A deep learning technology used for image classification and object detection tasks. CNNs employ convolutional layers to automatically extract features from images.

8. Forms of Supervised Learning (with examples):

Classification: Assigns labels to input data. Example: Spam email classification (categorizing emails as spam or not).

Regression: Predicts a continuous numeric value. Example: Predicting house prices based on features like square footage and location.

9. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning (with examples):

Supervised Learning: Requires labeled data for training. Example: Identifying hand-written digits (0-9) based on labeled image data.

Unsupervised Learning: Doesn't use labeled data; it discovers patterns or structures. Example: Clustering news articles into topics based on their content similarity.

10. Machine Learning Process:

Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection/Engineering
Model Selection
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Model Deployment
Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

ii) Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has made significant advancements and found numerous applications in the healthcare industry. Its ability to analyze large volumes of complex medical data, such as medical images and electronic health records, has the potential to improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.

iii) The study of the market basket, often referred to as "Market Basket Analysis" or "Association Rule Mining," is a data mining and analytics technique used in retail and business to understand purchasing patterns of customers. It involves analyzing the items that customers frequently purchase together to identify patterns, associations, and trends. This analysis can provide valuable insights for businesses, particularly in the retail sector.

11. Comparison:

Generalization vs. Abstraction: Generalization is the model's ability to perform well on unseen data, while abstraction is the process of simplifying complex information to essential characteristics.

Guided Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning: Guided learning involves instruction or supervision, while unsupervised learning doesn't rely on labeled data or guidance.

Regression vs. Classification: Regression predicts continuous values, while classification assigns discrete labels to data.
