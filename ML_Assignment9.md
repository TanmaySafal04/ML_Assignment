# Answers

1) Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves transforming, selecting, or creating features to make them more informative for the specific task at hand.

Aspects:
Feature Extraction: Creating new features from existing ones, like extracting text features from a body of text, such as word count, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

Feature Transformation: Changing the representation of features, such as scaling, normalization, or logarithmic transformation.

Feature Selection: Choosing the most relevant features to reduce dimensionality and noise.

Feature Creation: Generating new features that capture important patterns or relationships in the data.

Handling Missing Data: Dealing with missing values in a meaningful way, like imputation or adding binary indicators.

Encoding Categorical Data: Converting categorical variables into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Feature Scaling: Standardizing features to bring them to a similar scale.

Proper feature engineering can lead to improved model performance, faster training times, and better generalization.


2) Feature selection is the process of choosing a subset of the most relevant features from the original set of features. Its aim is to improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, and enhance model interpretability.

3) 
Filter Methods: Use statistical measures to score and rank features independently of the machine learning algorithm. Examples include chi-squared test, correlation, and mutual information.

Wrapper Methods: Evaluate feature subsets by training and testing models iteratively. Examples include forward selection, backward elimination, and recursive feature elimination.

Embedded Methods: Feature selection is integrated into the model training process, like L1 regularization in linear models or tree-based feature importances.

Aim: The primary goal of feature selection is to improve model performance by reducing dimensionality, eliminating irrelevant features, and preventing overfitting.
Filter vs. Wrapper Approaches:

Filter Approach:
Pros: Fast and computationally efficient, independent of specific models, can handle high-dimensional data, can reveal feature dependencies.
Cons: Ignores interactions between features, might not select the best feature subset for a specific model.
Wrapper Approach:
Pros: Considers feature interactions, selects features optimized for a particular model, can lead to better model performance.
Cons: Computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, may not generalize well to other models or datasets.

4) 

i. Overall Feature Selection Process:

Collect and preprocess the dataset.
Perform feature engineering, if needed.
Choose a feature selection method (filter, wrapper, or embedded).
Evaluate the selected feature subset using cross-validation or a holdout dataset.
Fine-tune the model if necessary.

ii. Feature Extraction Principle:

Example: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principle: Reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible.
PCA identifies orthogonal components (principal components) that capture the most variation in the data.
Widely used feature extraction algorithms: PCA, LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding).


5) In text categorization, feature engineering involves converting text data into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand.
Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and n-grams.
Additional text-specific preprocessing steps like stop word removal, stemming, and lemmatization are often employed.

6) Cosine Similarity:

Cosine similarity is a good metric for text categorization because it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space.
To find the cosine similarity, use the formula: cosine_similarity = (A . B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
For the given document-term matrix rows (2, 3, 2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 1) and (2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1), the cosine similarity is calculated as: (2*2 + 3*1 + 2*0 + 0*0 + 2*3 + 3*2 + 3*1 + 0*3 + 1*1) / (sqrt(2^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 + 1^2) * sqrt(2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 1^2))


7) 

i) Formula: Hamming distance between two equal-length strings of symbols is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
Between "10001011" and "11001111": Hamming distance = 3 (positions with differences).

ii) Jaccard Index and Similarity Matching Coefficient:

Jaccard Index: Measures the similarity between two sets by calculating the size of their intersection divided by the size of their union.
Jaccard Index = (Number of common elements) / (Total number of distinct elements)
Similarity Matching Coefficient: Measures similarity by considering the number of matching elements divided by the total number of elements.
Similarity Matching Coefficient = (Number of matching elements) / (Total number of elements)
For the given feature sets, the Jaccard Index and Similarity Matching Coefficient can be calculated accordingly.


8) 
High-dimensional data sets have a large number of features or dimensions relative to the number of samples.
Examples: Gene expression data, image data with pixel values, social network data with user attributes.
Difficulties: Curse of dimensionality (increased computational complexity, overfitting, difficulty in visualization), increased risk of noisy and irrelevant features.
Solutions: Feature selection, dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE), regularization methods, collecting more data if possible.


9) 
PCA: Principal Component Analysis, not Personal Computer Analysis. It's a dimensionality reduction technique.
Use of Vectors: Vectors are mathematical entities used to represent data in multi-dimensional space.
Embedded Technique: An approach where feature selection is integrated into the model training process.
Comparisons:

10)
i) Sequential Backward Exclusion vs. Sequential Forward Selection:
Both are feature selection methods.
Sequential Backward Exclusion starts with all features and iteratively removes the least important ones. It's generally more conservative.
Sequential Forward Selection starts with no features and adds them one by one. It can be more aggressive.
Function Selection Methods: Filter vs. Wrapper:

ii) Both are feature selection approaches.
Filter methods use statistical measures to rank features independently of a specific model.
Wrapper methods evaluate feature subsets by training and testing models iteratively, considering feature interactions.

iii) SMC vs. Jaccard Coefficient:
Both are similarity metrics.
SMC (Similarity Matching Coefficient) counts the number of matching elements divided by the total elements.
Jaccard Coefficient measures the intersection size divided by the union size of two sets.
